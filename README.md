The project features three stages:

1. Familiarize yourself with the business context. Use SQL to extract a customer dataset. Explore the data at different levels of aggregation and form a plan for further analysis.
2. Make calculations related to the business context then segment customer behavior data with statistical and visual techniques using the appropriate tools.
3. Create an executive summary and slides of the customer segmentation results and record a video presentation.

Project Motivation

What is segmentation? 

It refers to a broad category of analytic techniques that allow us to group similar data points. In this project, data points will represent customers, who we will group according to their shopping behavior in the context of a very specific business initiative.
